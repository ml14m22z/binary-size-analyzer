    ml14m22z: write a recover size function to convert a file size in human-readable format to bytes

    GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a plan for the function:

    1. Define a function `recover_size` that takes a string as an argument.
    2. Split the string into two parts: the numerical part and the unit part.
    3. Define a list of size units in the same order as in the `convert_size` function.
    4. Find the index of the unit part in the list of size units.
    5. Calculate the size in bytes by multiplying the numerical part by 1024 raised to the power of the index.
    6. Return the size in bytes.

    Here's the Python code for the function:

    ```python
    def recover_size(size_str):
        """
        Convert a file size in human-readable format to bytes.

        Args:
            size_str (str): The file size in a human-readable format.

        Returns:
            int: The file size in bytes.
        """
        size_name = ("B", "KB", "MB", "GB", "TB", "PB", "EB", "ZB", "YB")
        size, unit = size_str.split()
        size = float(size)
        unit_index = size_name.index(unit)
        size_bytes = size * math.pow(1024, unit_index)
        return int(size_bytes)
    ```

    Please note that this function assumes that the input string is in the correct format. If the input string can be in an incorrect format, you should add error handling code.
